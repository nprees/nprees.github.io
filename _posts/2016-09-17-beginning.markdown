<h2>Where to Begin </h2>

<p>Beginning a new project can be tough, so I’ve decided - hopefully to benefit both myself and anyone reading - to record the process of building a small, reusable and modular infographic library utilising D3.js.</p>

<p>The idea is to build a library that can work like a puzzle, where pieces seamlessly fit on top of one another in such a way that the visuals are neither boring nor repetitive, but will still carry the desired visual identity.</p>

<p>From the outset, It’s important not to be blinded by any seemingly unsurmountable obstacles, which means approaching this in one step at a time.</p>
